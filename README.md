For the sole purpose of Web dev class 2023 Assignments

\*\* Here I have added Java script to my css. Since there is no much need of Js I used it for parts thats must example the off canvas was somewhat broken without using JS so I fixed that.

\*\* I could have also used JS for the contact form but SInce that neeeds password I dont think its safe to use that yet.
