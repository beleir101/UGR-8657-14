                <h2>Hiking</h2>
                <p>Exploring the great outdoors is my escape from the digital world. Hiking, camping, and capturing the beauty of nature through photography are integral parts of my downtime. It's a refreshing way to recharge and find inspiration away from the screen.</p>

            <h2>Competitive Programming</h2>
            <p>In the realm of competitive programming, I find joy in the art of algorithmic problem-solving. Platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank become arenas where I hone my coding skills, tackling challenges that range from the intriguing to the downright complex. The adrenaline rush from optimizing code for efficiency and crafting elegant solutions mirrors the strategic thinking required in a chess match. The thrill of seeing a perfectly executed algorithm is my version of a checkmate in the coding world.</p>
            <p>The two platforms were I perform competitive programming are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://codeforces.com/">Codeforces</a></li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Chess</h2>
            <p>Chess is not just a game for me; it's a passion that embodies strategy, foresight, and the thrill of outsmarting an opponent. Whether engaged in friendly matches at the local chess club or participating in online tournaments, each move on the board is a calculated step in a mental journey. The lessons from chess—anticipation, adaptability, and precision—resonate with me, influencing not only my gaming strategy but also my approach to problem-solving in the world of programming.</p>
            <p>The two platforms were I perform competitive programming are:</p>

            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>In the virtual realm, I enjoy immersing myself in gaming adventures. Whether it's solving puzzles, strategizing in multiplayer games, or exploring vast open worlds, gaming is my go-to for relaxation and occasional friendly competition.</p>
