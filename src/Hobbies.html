            <h2>Competitive Programming</h2>
            <p>In the realm of competitive programming, I find joy in the art of algorithmic problem-solving. Platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank become arenas where I hone my coding skills, tackling challenges that range from the intriguing to the downright complex. The adrenaline rush from optimizing code for efficiency and crafting elegant solutions mirrors the strategic thinking required in a chess match. The thrill of seeing a perfectly executed algorithm is my version of a checkmate in the coding world.The two platforms were I perform competitive programming are:</p>
