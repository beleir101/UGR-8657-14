                <h2>Quiz System</h2>
                <p>When I was a fist year student here in addis ababa university me and my friend developed a quiz asking app.</p>
                <p>
                    A user can get his mind off of the things that are bothering him at the moment as well as test his general knowledge.

                <p>I did this one last summer.It was a simple e-commerce website with features like product listings,shopping cart, and checkout.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Expense Tracking</h2>
            <p>This was done for my personal uses. As I was expending withou plan I needed to see how much I was spending and which things took my money more and I did this expense tracking app.</p>
            <p>This app has also incorporated data visualization for a clear representation of expenditure.</p>
