            <h2>E-commerce Website</h2>
            <p>I did this one last summer.It was a simple e-commerce website with features like product listings,shopping cart, and checkout.</p>
            <h2>Expense Tracking</h2>
            <p>This was done for my personal uses. As I was expending withou plan I needed to see how much I was spending and which things took my money more and I did this expense tracking app.This app has also incorporated data visualization for a clear representation of expenditure.</p>
